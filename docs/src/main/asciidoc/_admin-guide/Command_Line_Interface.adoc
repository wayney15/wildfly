The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a management tool for a managed
domain or standalone server. It allows a user to connect to the domain
controller or a standalone server and execute management operations
available through the de-typed management model.

[[running-the-cli]]
== Running the CLI

Depending on the operating system, the CLI is launched using
`jboss-cli.sh` or `jboss-cli.bat` located in the WildFly `bin`
directory. For further information on the default directory structure,
please consult the " link:Getting_Started_Guide{outfilesuffix}[Getting Started
Guide]".

The first thing to do after the CLI has started is to connect to a
managed WildFly instance. This is done using the command _connect_, e.g.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
./bin/jboss-cli.sh
You are disconnected at the moment. Type 'connect' to connect to the server
or 'help' for the list of supported commands.
[disconnected /]
 
[disconnected /] connect
[domain@localhost:9990 /]
 
[domain@localhost:9990 /] quit
Closed connection to localhost:9990
----

`localhost:9990` is the default host and port combination for the
WildFly CLI client.

The host and the port of the server can be provided as an optional
parameter, if the server is not listening on localhost:9990.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
./bin/jboss-cli.sh
You are disconnected at the moment. Type 'connect' to connect to the server
[disconnected /] connect 192.168.0.10:9990
Connected to standalone controller at 192.168.0.1:9990
----

The :9990 is not required as the CLI will use port 9990 by default. The
port needs to be provided if the server is listening on some other port.

To terminate the session type _quit_.

[TIP]

The jboss-cli script accepts a --connect parameter: ./jboss-cli.sh
--connect

The --controller parameter can be used to specify the host and port of
the server: ./jboss-cli.sh --connect --controller=192.168.0.1:9990

Help is also available:

In order to list the set of commands that are currently available in the current context
use the option _--commands_ (NB: the following examples are not displaying an
exhaustive set of CLI commands, more and/or different commands could be available
in your running CLI instance):

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
[domain@localhost:9990 /] help --commands
Commands available in the current context:
batch               connection-factory  deployment-overlay  if                  patch               reload              try
cd                  connection-info     echo                jdbc-driver-info    pwd                 rollout-plan        undeploy
clear               data-source         echo-dmr            jms-queue           quit                run-batch           unset
command             deploy              help                jms-topic           read-attribute      set                 version
connect             deployment-info     history             ls                  read-operation      shutdown            xa-data-source
To read a description of a specific command execute 'help <command name>'.
----

The _help_ command can print help for any command or operation. For operations,
the operation description is formatted as a command help (synopsis, description and
options). Some commands (eg: _patch_) expose two levels of documentation. A high
level description for the command itself and a dedicated help content for each action (eg: _apply_).
The help documentation of each command makes it clear if this two levels are available or not.

Use Tab-completion to discover the set of commands and operations:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
help <TAB>
----
The list of all commands (enabled or not) is displayed.

Examples

* Display the help of the _patch_ command:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
help patch
----

* Display the help of the _apply_ action of the _patch_ command:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
help patch apply
----

* Display the description of the _elytron_ _key-store_ resource _add_ operation
formatted as a command help content:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
help /subsystem=elytron/key-store=?:add
----

[[cli-keyboard-navigation]]
== Keyboard navigation

In order to efficiently edit commands, the CLI allows you to navigate the words
 and characters of a command using the keyboard.

NB: Part of this navigation is platform dependent.

=== Go left (back) one word

* _Alt+B_ : Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, Windows.
* _Ctrl+LeftArrow_: Linux, Solaris, HP-UX.
* _Alt+LeftArrow_: Mac OSX.

=== Go right (forward) one word

* _Alt+F_ : Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, Windows.
* _Ctrl+RightArrow_: Linux, Solaris, HP-UX.
* _Alt+RightArrow_: Mac OSX.

=== Go to the beginning of the line

* _Ctrl+A_: All supported platforms.
* _HOME_:  Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, Windows

=== Go to the end of the line

* _Ctrl+E_: All supported platforms.
* _END_: Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, Windows

=== Go left (back) one character

* _Ctrl+B_ or _LeftArrow_: All supported platforms.

=== Go right (forward) one character

* _Ctrl+F_ or _RightArrow_: All supported platforms.


[[cli-non-interactive-mode]]
== Non-interactive Mode

The CLI can also be run in non-interactive mode to support scripts and
other types of command line or batch processing. The --command and
--commands arguments can be used to pass a command or a list of commands
to execute. Additionally a --file argument is supported which enables
CLI commands to be provided from a text file.

For example the following command can be used to list all the current
deployments

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ ./bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --commands=ls\ deployment
sample.war
business.jar
----

The output can be combined with other shell commands for further
processing, for example to find out what .war files are deployed:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ ./bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --commands=ls\ deployment | grep war
sample.war
----

In order to match a command with its output, you can provide the option
--echo-command (or add the XML element <echo-command> to the CLI
configuration file) in order to make the CLI to include the prompt +
command + options in the output. With this option enabled, any executed
command will be added to the output.

[[command-timeout]]
== Command timeout

By default CLI command and operation executions are not timely bounded.
It means that a command never ending its execution will make the CLI
process to be stuck and unresponsive. To protect the CLI from this
behavior, one can set a command execution timeout.

[[command-timeout-behavior]]
=== Command Timeout behavior

In interactive mode, when a timeout occurs, an error message is
displayed then the console prompt is made available to type new
commands. In non interactive mode (executing a script or a list of
commands), when a timeout occurs, an exception is thrown and the CLI
execution is stopped. In both modes (interactive and non interactive),
when a timeout occurs, the CLI will make a best effort to cancel the
associated server side activities.

[[configuring-the-command-timeout]]
=== Configuring the Command timeout

* Add the XML element _<command-timeout>\{num
seconds}</command-timeout>_ to the CLI XML configuration file.
* Add the option - _-command-timeout=\{num seconds}_ to the CLI command
line. This will override any value set in the XML configuration file.

[[managing-the-command-timeout]]
=== Managing the Command Timeout

Once the CLI is running, the timeout can be adjusted to cope with the
commands to execute. For example a batch command will need a longer
timeout than a non batch one. The command _command-timeout_ allows to
get, set and reset the command timeout.

[[retrieving-the-command-timeout]]
=== Retrieving the command timeout

The command _command-timeout get_ displays the current timeout in
seconds. A timeout of 0 means no timeout.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] command-timeout get
0
----

[[setting-the-command-timeout]]
=== Setting the command timeout

The command _command-timeout set_ update the timeout value to a number
of seconds. If a timeout has been set via configuration (XML file or
option), it is overridden by the _set_ action.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] command-timeout set 10
----

[[resetting-the-command-timeout]]
=== Resetting the command timeout

The command _command-timeout reset \{config|default}_ allows to set the
timeout to its configuration value (XML file or option) or default value
(0 second). If no configuration value is set, resetting to the
configuration value sets the timeout to its default value (0 seconds).

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] command-timeout reset config
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] command-timeout reset default
----

[[default-native-management-interface-security]]
== Default Native Management Interface Security

The native interface shares the same security configuration as the http
interface, however we also support a local authentication mechanism
which means that the CLI can authenticate against the local WildFly
instance without prompting the user for a username and password. This
mechanism only works if the user running the CLI has read access to the
standalone/tmp/auth folder or domain/tmp/auth folder under the
respective WildFly installation - if the local mechanism fails then the
CLI will fallback to prompting for a username and password for a user
configured as in <<Default_HTTP_Interface_Security,Default HTTP Interface Security>>.

Establishing a CLI connection to a remote server will require a username
and password by default.

[[operation-requests]]
== Operation Requests

Operation requests allow for low level interaction with the management
model. They are different from the high level commands (i.e.
_create-jms-queue_) in that they allow you to read and modify the server
configuration as if you were editing the XML configuration files
directly. The configuration is represented as a tree of addressable
resources, where each node in the tree (aka resource) offers a set of
operations to execute.

An operation request basically consists of three parts: The _address_,
an _operation name_ and an optional set of _parameters_.

The formal specification for an operation request is:

....
[/node-type=node-name (/node-type=node-name)*] : operation-name [( [parameter-name=parameter-value (,parameter-name=parameter-value)*] )]
....

For example:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
/subsystem=logging/root-logger=ROOT:change-root-log-level(level=WARN)
----

Tab Completion

Tab-completion is supported for all commands and options, i.e.
node-types and node-names, operation names and parameter names.

In operation Tab-completion, required parameters have a name terminated by the
'*' character. This helps identify which are the parameters that must be set in order to
construct a valid operation. Furthermore, Tab-completion does not propose
parameters that are alternatives of parameters already present in the operation.

For example:
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
/deployment=myapp:add(<TAB>
!  content*  enabled  runtime-name
----
The parameter _content_ is required and completion advertises it with a '*' character.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
/deployment=myapp:add-content(content=[{<TAB>
bytes*  hash*  input-stream-index*  target-path*  url*
----
_bytes_, _hash_, _input-stream-index_ and _url_ are required but also alternatives
(only one of them can be set). As soon as one of these parameter has been set, the
others are no longer proposed by completion.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
/deployment=myapp:add-content(content=[{url=myurl,<TAB>
/deployment=myapp:add-content(content=[{url=myurl,target-path
----
_target-path_ argument is automatically inlined in the command.

[TIP]

We are also considering adding aliases that are less verbose for the user, and
will translate into the corresponding operation requests in the
background.

Whitespaces between the separators in the operation request strings are
not significant.

[[addressing-resources]]
=== Addressing resources

Operation requests might not always have the address part or the
parameters. E.g.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
:read-resource
----

which will list all the node types for the current node.

To syntactically disambiguate between the commands and operations,
operations require one of the following prefixes:

To execute an operation against the current node, e.g.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
cd subsystem=logging
:read-resource(recursive="true")
----

To execute an operation against a child node of the current node, e.g.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
cd subsystem=logging
./root-logger=ROOT:change-root-log-level(level=WARN)
----

To execute an operation against the root node, e.g.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
/:read-resource
----

[[available-operation-types-and-descriptions]]
=== Available Operation Types and Descriptions

The operation types can be distinguished between common operations that
exist on any node and specific operations that belong to a particular
configuration resource (i.e. subsystem). The common operations are:

* add
* read-attribute
* read-children-names
* read-children-resources
* read-children-types
* read-operation-description
* read-operation-names
* read-resource
* read-resource-description
* remove
* validate-address
* write-attribute

For a list of specific operations (e.g. operations that relate to the
logging subsystem) you can always query the model itself. For example,
to read the operations supported by the logging subsystem resource on a
standalone server:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
[[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=logging:read-operation-names
{
   "outcome" => "success",
   "result" => [
       "add",
       "change-root-log-level",
       "read-attribute",
       "read-children-names",
       "read-children-resources",
       "read-children-types",
       "read-operation-description",
       "read-operation-names",
       "read-resource",
       "read-resource-description",
       "remove-root-logger",
       "root-logger-assign-handler",
       "root-logger-unassign-handler",
       "set-root-logger",
       "validate-address",
       "write-attribute"
   ]
}
----

As you can see, the logging resource offers four additional operations,
namely _root-logger-assign-handler_, _root-logger-unassign-handler_,
_set-root-logger_ and _remove-root-logger_.

Further documentation about a resource or operation can be retrieved
through the description:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=logging:read-operation-description(name=change-root-log-level)
{
   "outcome" => "success",
   "result" => {
       "operation-name" => "change-root-log-level",
       "description" => "Change the root logger level.",
       "request-properties" => {"level" => {
           "type" => STRING,
           "description" => "The log level specifying which message levels will be logged by this logger.
                            Message levels lower than this value will be discarded.",
           "required" => true
       }}
   }
}
----

Full model

[TIP]

To see the full model enter `:read-resource(recursive=true)`.

[[command-history]]
== Command History

Command (and operation request) history is enabled by default. The
history is kept both in-memory and in a file on the disk, i.e. it is
preserved between command line sessions. The history file name is
.jboss-cli-history and is automatically created in the user's home
directory. When the command line interface is launched this file is read
and the in-memory history is initialized with its content.

[TIP]

While in the command line session, you can use the arrow keys to go back
and forth in the history of commands and operations.

To manipulate the history you can use the _history_ command. If executed
without any arguments, it will print all the recorded commands and
operations (up to the configured maximum, which defaults to 500) from
the in-memory history.

_history_ supports three optional arguments:

* _disable_ - will disable history expansion (but will not clear the
previously recorded history);
* _enabled_ - will re-enable history expansion (starting from the last
recorded command before the history expansion was disabled);
* _clear_ - will clear the in-memory history (but not the file one).

[[json-and-dmr-output]]
== JSON and DMR output

By default the CLI prints operation results using the DMR textual syntax. There are
two ways to make the CLI to display JSON:

* _--output-json_ option when launching the CLI.
* _<output-json>_ XML element added to _jboss-cli.xml_ configuration file.

[[color-output]]
== Color output

The CLI outputs results of commands and the prompt in color. To disable this, there are two possible ways to disable it:

* _--no-color-output_ will disable color output;
* Change _<enabled>_ to `false` in `jboss-cli.xml`.

The _<color-output>_ block is  used to configure the  colors of the six basic elements that do support it

- Output messages: error, warning and success;
- Required configuration options when using the auto-complete functionality;
- The color of the default prompt;
- The color of the prompt when using `batch` and any of the workflow commands, `if`, `for` and `try`.

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<color-output>
    <enabled>true</enabled>
    <error-color>red</error-color>
    <warn-color>yellow</warn-color>
    <success-color>default</success-color>
    <required-color>magenta</required-color>
    <workflow-color>green</workflow-color>
    <prompt-color>blue</prompt-color>
</color-output>
----

There are eight available colors:

|===
|Black|Magenta
|Blue|Red
|Cyan|White
|Green|Yellow
|===

There is also the possibility of using the _default_ color, which is the terminal's configured foreground color.

[[paging-output]]
== Paging and searching output

In interactive mode, when the content to display is longer than the terminal
 height, the content is paged. You can navigate the content by using the following
 keys and mouse events:

* space or PAGE_DOWN: scroll the content one page down.
* '\' or PAGE_UP: scroll the content one page up.
* ';' or up arrow or mouse wheel up: scroll the content one line up.
* ENTER or down arrow or mouse wheel down: scroll the content one line down.
* HOME or 'g': scroll to the top of the content. NB: HOME is only supported
 for keyboards containing this key.
* END or 'G': scroll to the bottom of the content. NB: END is only supported
 for keyboards containing this key.
* 'q' or 'Q' or ESC: exit the paging.

NB: When the end of the content is reached (using ENTER, space, ...) the paging
 is automatically exited.

It is possible to search for text when the content is paged. Search is operated
 with the following keys:

* '/' to display prompt allowing to type some text. Type return to launch the search. +
You can use up/down arrows to retrieve previously typed text. NB: search history
 is not persisted when CLI process exits.
* 'n' to jump to the next match if any. If no search text has been typed, then the
 last entry from the search history is used.
* 'N' to jump to the previous match if any. If no search text has been typed,
 then the last entry from the search history is used.

There are two possible ways *to disable* the output paging and write the whole output of the commands at once:

* _--no-output-paging_ command line parameter will disable the output paging;
* Add _<output-paging>false<output-paging>_ in `jboss-cli.xml`.

[WARNING]

On Windows, searching and navigating backward is only supported starting with Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016.

[WARNING]

If the CLI process is sent the signal KILL(9) while it is paging, the terminal will stay
 in alternate mode. This makes the terminal to behave in an unexpected manner (display and mouse events).
 In order to restore the terminal state call: _tput rmcup_.

[[batch-processing]]
== Batch Processing

The batch mode allows one to group commands and operations and execute
them together as an atomic unit. If at least one of the commands or
operations fails, all the other successfully executed commands and
operations in the batch are rolled back.

Not all of the commands are allowed in the batch. For example, commands
like _cd_, _ls_, _help_, etc. are not allowed in the batch since they
don't translate into operation requests. Only the commands that
translate into operation requests are allowed in the batch. The batch,
actually, is executed as a composite operation request.

The batch mode is entered by executing command _batch_.

----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] batch
[standalone@localhost:9990 / #] /subsystem=datasources/data-source="java\:\/H2DS":enable
[standalone@localhost:9990 / #] /subsystem=messaging-activemq/server=default/jms-queue=newQueue:add
----

You can execute a batch using the _run-batch_ command:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 / #] run-batch
The batch executed successfully.
----

Exit the batch edit mode without losing your changes:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 / #] holdback-batch
[standalone@localhost:9990 /]
----

Then activate it later on again:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] batch
Re-activated batch
#1 /subsystem=datasources/data-source=java:/H2DS:\/H2DS:enable
----

There are several other notable batch commands available as well (tab
complete to see the list):

* _clear-batch_
* _edit-batch-line_ (e.g. _edit-batch line 3 create-jms-topic
name=mytopic_)
* _remove-batch-line_ (e.g. _remove-batch-line 3_)
* _move-batch-line_ (e.g. _move-batch-line 3 1_)
* _discard-batch_

== Operators

CLI has some operators that are similar to shell operators:

* _>_ To redirect the output of a command/operation to a file:
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
:read-resource > my-file.txt
----

* _>>_ To redirect the output of a command/operation and append it at the end of a file:
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
:read-resource >> my-file.txt
----

* _|_ To redirect the output of a command/operation to the _grep_ command:
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
:read-resource | grep undefined
----
